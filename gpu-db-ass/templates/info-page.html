    <h2>&nbsp;catagory explainations:</h2>
    <h3>&nbsp;chip manufacture-</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;In terms of graphics cards, NVIDIA is known for its high-end GPUs with advanced features like ray tracing and AI capabilities, while AMD focuses on providing powerful yet cost-effective GPUs that offer competitive performance, especially in multi-platform gaming.</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;series-</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;the series of cards changes every once in a while with new card architecture</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;GPU-</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;This is the name of the specific GPU</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;Vram-</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;VRAM (Video Random Access Memory) is specialized memory used by a graphics card to store image data and textures for fast access and rendering in visual applications.</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;clockspeed in MHz-</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;Clock speed in GPUs refers to the frequency at which the graphics processing unit operates, determining how quickly it can process instructions and perform calculations.</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;is currently manufactured-</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;Whether the card is still made</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;average price NZD-</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;How much the card will cost you on average in New Zealand.</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;average benchmark-</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;The average graphics rating of the card for gaming performance, this number is not standardised in any way but all of my results are taken from the same place (3D_benchmark.com) so the benchmarks are accurate to eachother.</p>
